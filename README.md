# autometer-demo-multiMaster 

This setup will be like having multiple k8s cluster and each cluster will have the master & slave setup in it. We can test it with only one JMX with multiple CSV files. So, this will be running like single JMX files from different region masters and the test trigger will happen at the same time for the masters.(time difference will be like 5-10sec) to trigger each masters.
